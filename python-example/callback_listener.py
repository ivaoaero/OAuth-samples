"""
This script starts a local server to listen for the callback from the IVAO SSO.

When the callback is received, the server will print the authorization code to the console.
This is an example of how to use the OAuth2 class to authenticate with the IVAO SSO.
Please refer to the IVAO API documentation for more information on how to use the authorization code to get an access token: https://api.ivao.aero/
For OAuth2 documentation, see https://oauth.net/2/


To run this script, you need to explicitly install flask[async] in order for it to work. (pip install 'flask[async]')

This script is not intended to be used in a production environment, it is only a demonstration of how to use the OAuth2 class to authenticate with the IVAO SSO.

Functions
---------
async def callback() -> str:
    Asyncronous function.
    This function is called when the callback is received from the IVAO SSO.
    It will print the authorization code to the console and return a message to the user in the browser.

async def start_server(server_started: asyncio.Event) -> None:
    Asyncronous function.
    This function starts the server to listen for the callback.

def getcookie() -> dict:
    This function is used to get the cookie from the browser storage. It can be printed to the user, or used in the code as a variable.

async def main() -> None:
    Asyncronous function.
    This function gets the authorization code from the user and prints it to the console.
